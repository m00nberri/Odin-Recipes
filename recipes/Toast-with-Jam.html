        Toast with jam is a very traditional dish dating back to the dark ages. It was a great way for field serfs to start their morning right with a sweet kick of energy.

        This is a recipe that was handed down to me by my great grandparents. They were toast farmers. It always tastes amazing and I hope you can enjoy making it too.

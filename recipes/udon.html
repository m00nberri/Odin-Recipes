        Udon is a delicious dish of noodles and hearty broth. It's great to eat on cold days, and even hot days if you eat it cold.

        This is a recipe that was handed down to me by my great grandparents. They were udon farmers. It always tastes amazing and I hope you can enjoy making it too.
